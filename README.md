# Animal Shelter Dashboard

A dashboard built to get the administrative side of things off the people running animal shelters

## What am I trying to acomplish?

- [ ] Keeping inventory of all of the animals
  - [ ] Their diseases
  - [ ] Eating needs
  - [ ] How much money is getting spent on them
  - [ ] Their last visits and their descriptions
  - [ ] Which medication are they taking and how often they should take it
  - [ ] Where are they - it might be a simple - "Room 2" or it could be a half adopted animal that is kept in a person house
  - [ ] For what where they tested?
  - [ ] A simple information short - race, name, age, health status, personality
  - [ ] images, videos
- [ ] Keeping track of a shelters needs
  - [ ] How much money they need? Whom needs to be paid and how much?
  - [ ] How much do they get from people?
  - [ ] How many animals are they rescuing?
  - [ ] How many animals are getting adopted?
  - [ ] How much food, blankets and other stuff they have? And for how long will it last?
  - [ ] Keeping a list of things that they got - what they got, when and from who?
  - [ ] How much space they have and how much is taken?
- [ ] Keeping a list of animals that were taken, neutered and allowed to go back to nature
- [ ] Keeping a list of people that have gotted pets adopted
- [ ] Keeping a list of people that are making problems for the shelters
- [ ] Allow a shelter to create a board of notes to keep for each other
- [ ] Allow this app to be connected with multiple other applications that help the shelters
